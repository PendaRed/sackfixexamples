# SackFix Examples

SackFix is a Scala Fix Engine - ie a session layer fix implememtion including all messages and fields as strongly types classes.   This project includes example code on how to write your own Fix acceptor or initiator 
using AKKA.   This is probably the only project you should copy - and then cut and paste the code you want into your own projects.

Please visit [sackfix.org](http://www.sackfix.org) for instructions on how to run the initiator and acceptor.

Best wishes,
Jonathan
